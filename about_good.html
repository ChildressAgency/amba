    <h2>About AMBA</h2>
    The Association of Military Banks of America (AMBA) was founded in 1959. AMBA is a not for profit association of
    banks operating on military installations, banks not located on military installations but serving military
    customers, and military banking facilities designated by the U. S. Treasury. The association's membership includes
    both community banks and large multinational financial institutions, all of which are insured by the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="newpar">The Association of Military Banks (AMBA) is the only trade association representing banking
      institutions specializing in providing banking services for military personnel and their families around the
      world. AMBA has a long history of partnering with the Department of Defense for the benefit of military members
      and their dependents. AMBA’s membership includes large and small national and state chartered banks, most
      operating on military installations and all insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). AMBA
      represents the interests of banking institutions serving the military. AMBA serves as a liaison with DoD, Defense
      Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Military Services, Treasury, FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the
      Currency (OCC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and its Office of Service member Affairs (OSA).</p>
    <p class="newpar">Our mission is to continue the close working relationship with the nation’s major banking trade
      associations, including the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America, and the
      federal banking regulators.</p>
    <p class="newpar">AMBA works closely with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) which administers the
      overseas worldwide military banking program through a contract with Bank of America, one of AMBA’s member banks.
      AMBA helps the commercial banking industry maintain regulatory compliance with the Department of Defense.</p>
    <p class="newpar">AMBA sustains partnerships and relationships with many government and non-profit organizations
      that support military families, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – Office of Servicemember
      Affairs, Department of Justice, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Trade Commission, National Military
      Family Association, Military Spouse Employment Partnership, Military Officer’s Association of America, the
      Consumer Federation of America's Military Saves Campaign, BBB Military Line, and the Financial Industry Regulatory
      Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Foundation.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of an On-Base Bank</h2>
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Passion: </b>&nbsp;Military banks are full-service financial
          institutions with experience in and a passion for serving the unique needs of military personnel and their
          families.</span></li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Full service: </b>Military banks do not limit their services to their
          customers; they provide services to customers and non-customers in the military communities they serve.</span>
      </li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Partnership:</b> &nbsp;On-base banks partner with the commands and the
          military communities they serve by providing financial services and sponsoring community activities and
          programs.</span></li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Financial education: </b>&nbsp;Military banks are committed in their
          operating agreements to provide financial education to all base personnel and family members. &nbsp;This
          benefit is particularly important as Congress redefines military compensation and retirement benefits.</span>
      </li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Responsible lending:</b> &nbsp;On-base banks engage in responsible
          lending by helping qualified service members and their families bridge occasional gaps between paychecks.
          &nbsp;As alternatives to predatory lending often available outside the installation’s main gate, military
          banks offer loans at reasonable prices and employ lending practices designed to improve borrower
          credit.</span></li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Choice: &nbsp;</b>All on-base banks provide military members, civilian
          employees, and their families a choice of financial service providers without requiring them to leave the
          base. &nbsp;This choice results in a healthy competition through increased availability of products and
          services, improved delivery methods, and more favorable prices for members of the military community.</span>
      </li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Command support:</b> &nbsp;Most military banks are participants in the
          Treasury General Account program, through which they provide financial services to federal entities on the
          installation. &nbsp;These banks also store cash, thereby eliminating the need for on-base entities to
          transport their funds off-base.</span></li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Convenience: </b>&nbsp;Some military banks are located inside Military
          Exchanges and offer financial services during Exchange operating hours. Most on-base banks manage ATM machines
          that provide access to cash 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</span></li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Support to the mission:</b>&nbsp;Commercial, nonprofit, and other
          on-base accounts can be maintained at military banks. &nbsp;Alternatives such as personnel traveling off-base
          to perform these financial tasks potentially adversely impact their unit’s mission.</span></li>
      <li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Expeditionary:</b> &nbsp;Military banks serve where our military
          serves. &nbsp;Whether through on-base banks in the United States or abroad or through electronic bank networks
          like the Armed Forces Financial Network (AFFN), military banks provide military members access to their money
          wherever they are assigned or deployed.</span></li>

        the Association of Military Banks of America (AMBA)</strong></h2>
    AFFN was founded in 1985 at the request of the U.S. Army in support of the "Surepay" direct deposit system, to
    provide U.S. Military personnel (active, reserve, dependents, and retired) with access to their funds through ATM
    and POS terminals at or near U.S. Military bases worldwide. AFFN's mission is to increase the versatility of
    participating financial institutions to better serve the U.S. Military. &nbsp;AFFN is co-owned by the Association of
    Military Banks of America (AMBA) and the Defense Credit Union Council (DCUC).
    <h3>AFFN Military Community Support Program</h3>
    <p class="newpar">The Armed Forces Financial Network (AFFN), in partnership with the Association of Military Banks
      of America (AMBA) and the Defense Credit Union Council (DCUC), has proudly supported the Fisher House Foundation
      and the individual Fisher Houses in Germany and the United States for the past ten years.</p>
    <p class="newpar"><strong>The AFFN Military Community Support Program has generously given back to the Troops and
        their families over $2,700,000.00 in direct support over the past decade.</strong></p>
    <p class="newpar">The AFFN Matching Grant Program is in the 13th year of giving at the local military installation
      and community level by AFFN, AMBA Banks, and DCUC Credit Unions.</p>
    <p class="newpar">Since 2004, AFFN in partnership with AMBA Banks and DCUC Credit Unions, have awarded over 516
      grants to support our military and civilian communities on a local level and on a global scale, directly
      benefiting military service members and their families worldwide.</p>
    <p class="newpar">The other component of the AFFN Military Community Support Program is the AFFN corporate
      contribution, made on behalf of all AFFN Participating AMBA Banks and DCUC Credit Unions. For the past thirteen
      years, the AFFN Board of Directors has unanimously approved the corporate contribution in direct support of
      military families staying at Fisher Houses in Germany and throughout the United States.</p>
    <p class="newpar">Since 2005, 12,242 military families staying at Fisher Houses worldwide have received over
      $612,100.00 in DeCA Certifichecks (2005, 2006) and AFFN Thank You Cards ((2007-2016) from the AFFN Military
      Community Support Program. Every dollar distributed has proudly assisted military service members, Veterans,
      and/or Military Family Members for care, comfort, and food while staying at a Fisher House.</p>

    <p><strong>For over fifty-five years, AMBA has been the exclusive military banking trade association servicing the banking community and our Nation’s armed forces.</strong></p>
    <p>In two full days of the Association of Military Banks of America’s 2016 Workshop program, attendees heard from 31 speakers ranging from government and regulatory officials to military and veteran non-profit organizations. It was a busy two days and more than 18 hours of information, discussion and networking. One attendee described his thoughts about the Workshop: “I truly enjoyed the learning environment, the quality of the presentations, and the friendly atmosphere. I can see why the meetings are so well attended.”</p>
    <p>This year's Workshop offered 10 hours of CEUs for those with the Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC) with the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE). These credits were also accepted by the DoD Financial Manager (FM) Certification.</p>

          <li>Secretary Daniel Feehan, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Readiness), kicked off the 2016 AMBA Workshop bright and early on Monday morning. Mr. Feehan reminded attendees of the importance of collaboration among installation agencies. He focused on recent statistics from the Defense Manpower and Data Center (DMDC) which showed that 71% of military families are comfortable with their financial situation, 86% have established a savings habit, and over 50% are saving regularly. Mr. Feehan also highlighted the importance of financial health of military families and prompted us all to remember that we are working toward getting every service member “Ready to Fight. Ready for Life”. It was a great way to start the two-day Workshop.</li>
          <li>Continuing the morning, attendees heard from Ms. Grovetta Gardineer, Senior Deputy Comptroller for Compliance Operations and Policy, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ms. Gardineer, in addition to updating attendees on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and the new rules of the Military Lending Act (MLA), also touched on the subject of the future of military banking. Ms. Gardineer shared her thoughts on responsible innovation and her experience moderating a panel at another event this summer that focused on partnerships with banks and fintech firms bringing products and services to the 68 million underbanked Americans.</li>
          <li>Next up was Ms. Doreen Eberley, Director, FDIC division of Risk Management, Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation. Ms. Eberley, beyond her FDIC update, shared the FDIC Cybersecurity Awareness Resources and information -- everything from short videos to materials and an instructional guide -- that can be found on the FDIC.gov website. FDIC is working hard to increase their resources by adding these cybersecurity tools to their Community Banking Initiative.</li>
          <li>The Military Lending Act (MLA) Panel Discussion featured three panelists: Nessa Feddis, American Bankers Association; Todd Hill, Financial Services Roundtable; and Ben Olson, BuckleySandler LLP. All three panelists brought different expertise and a wealth of knowledge, history, and understanding of not only the new rules of the MLA, but the inner workings of the DoD database for covered borrowers and the financial industry. The collaboration with the Department of Defense and the government regulators was a theme throughout the panel discussion. It was a wonderful dialogue and noted by attendees as one of the most popular and informative discussions at the 2016 AMBA Workshop.</li>
          <li>During lunch, attendees were treated to a visit by former Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable John Dalton, president of the Housing Policy Council of the Financial Services Roundtable. Secretary Dalton, a noteworthy addition to the Workshop, shared his views on leadership. Attendees thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Dalton’s remarks during our first luncheon of the Workshop.</li>
          <li>Immediately following lunch, Ms. Holly Petraeus, Assistant Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Servicemember Affairs (OSA), updated the audience on what the OSA has accomplished over the last several months. OSA, led by Ms. Petraeus, is continuing with the financial education delayed entry program which has educated over 3,500 servicemembers before they come on active duty. CFPB employs financial coaches who have reached over 3,100 veterans through 40 Department of Labor centers and through teleconferencing. Ms. Petraeus also shared data points and other CFPB initiatives.</li>
          <li>The next session was Tales from the Teller Window. Dr. Lisa Servon brought a different perspective to the future of military banking by sharing her research and experience of working in the alternative services marketplace. Dr. Servon brought a new viewpoint and many in attendance were intrigued and fascinated by her remarks and research. She definitely began a new conversation.</li>
          <li>Mr. Cam Fine, the Independent Community Bankers Association’s president and CEO, addressed the Workshop for the second year in a row. Mr. Fine discussed the legislative landscape and regulatory scene affecting community banking. Like last year, Mr. Fine engaged the Workshop in another lively discussion.</li>
          <li>To end the first day of the Workshop, and prior to the Banking Liaison Officer training breakout session and AMBA General Membership meeting, attendees heard Dr. Gary Mottola describe the FINRA Investor Education’s 2015 National Financial Capability Study results. Results of the study show that although the financial situation of Americans has improved, overall financial literacy has stayed the same or declined. The results can be found at <a href="http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/results.php?region=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/results.php?region=US</a>. Dr. Mottola informed the audience that the Military Results will be available in November 2016.</li>

          <li>Day 2 of the Workshop started out with a great panel discussion about military families and financial readiness. The panel included, Joyce Wessel Raezer from the National Military Family Association, Brooke Goldberg from the Military Officers Association of America, Bud Schneeweis, from FINRA Investor Education Foundation, and Wayne Boswell from the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The discussion included personal finance gaps and how all stakeholders can work together to fill them, how to best reach millennials with messaging and communication (hint: they are still using Facebook!) and the new Blended Retirement System and how everyone needs to work together to inform and educate the force and families.</li>
          <li>After the military family panel, the Workshop dove right into another panel focused on alternative banking products and services. This panel included Peter Dugas from FiS, Arlene Siller-Jackson from LiftFund, Mark Rockefeller from StreetShares, and Michael Rowland from Broadway Bank. Each panelist brought a different perspective and solution to working with military members, veterans, and spouses. From innovative technology, to grassroots efforts to work one-on-one with clients, the discussion drove new thoughts and concepts.</li>
          <li>Next, attendees heard from the President and CEO of the American Bankers Association, Rob Nichols. Mr. Nichols shared ABA’s vision of the future and described how ABA is working toward its goal of reducing the regulatory burden on banks. The partnership between AMBA and ABA is strong and both groups are working together to secure bank lease relief for regular, on-installation AMBA member banks.</li>
          <li>Attendees were then moved to tears with the next speaker. Each year, AMBA provides a very special “Why We Serve” speaker to remind everyone working with the military community who we serve. This year’s speaker was Bonnie Carroll, president and founder, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS). Bonnie shared her personal story of loss and described the journey that led her to create TAPS. In addition, she shared the many programs, supports and camps that TAPS offers.</li>
          <li>After the Military Departments’ Bank of the Year Award Luncheon (see <a href="http://dev.childressagency.com/amba/presentation-2015-bank-year-awards-amba-workshop/">press release</a> for winners), the Banking Liaison Panel was up next with representatives from each service, CPT Chris Anderson, Elise Newton from the Navy, Jim Sisson from the Air Force and Dave Fuqua from the Marine Corps, and Bill Hawbecker from the Department of Defense. After Bill Hawbecker’s update, each service rep had a chance to provide updates on their respective service.</li>
          <li>James Lander from Military Saves was the next speaker. Mr. Lander updated attendees about the current Military Saves Campaign. He shared annual goals and milestones for the campaign, including new initiatives for the upcoming 2017 Military Saves Week, which will take place in February.</li>
          <li>John Broda from the Armed Forces Financial Network (AFFN) briefly spoke about AFFN military community support initiatives and then introduced Meghan Ogilvie from Dog Tag Bakery who was able to share the organization’s mission. She also shared some treats with the audience (what a treat!)</li>
          <li>To wrap-up our final day and session, Justin Link from Army CID and David Cunningham from the U.S. Postal Inspector’s office gave a briefing about bank theft, identity theft and the military. They informed attendees how the two agencies work together to catch offenders and how to report crimes.</li>
          <li>With 31 speakers in two days, it is easy to say that the 2016 AMBA Workshop was packed with information, discussion, questions and answers, tools and resources for all who attended. AMBA wants to extend a BIG thank you to all speakers, attendees and staff for another very successful annual Workshop.</li>
